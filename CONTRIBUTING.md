# Contributing to Contor

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Contor. It's people like you that will make Contor a truly useful application!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Contor is an open source project and we love to receive contributions â€” from you! There are many ways to contribute: Write tutorials or blog posts, improve the documentation, submit bug reports and feature requests, write code which can be incorporated into Contor itself or simply tweet out your support for the project.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Check whether the #contor IRC channel on Freenode can help with your issue.

## Ground Rules

Responsibilities
* Read the [Contor Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/contor-cloud/contor/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Try to name any issues or pull requests that you open as clearly as possible
* Allow edits from maintainers on your Pull Requests to make code review easier.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Contor? You can start by looking through [these help-wanted issues](https://github.com/contor-cloud/contor/labels/help%20wanted) and the [Roadmap Project](https://github.com/contor-cloud/contor/projects/1).

Working on your very first Git Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

If a maintainer asks you to "squash" your PR, they're saying that your Pull Request consists of multiple commits that should be rewritten into one single commit.

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help or guidance; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

## Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have tested your changes.
    * Create a dedicated topic/feature/bugfix branch for your changes on your fork.
    * Send a pull request from that branch.

## How to report a Bug
### Security Disclosures

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Any security issues should be submitted directly to github+security@contor.cloud instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at github+security@contor.cloud.

### Open an Issue on GitHub

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Contor are you using?
2. What version of Kubernetes/OpenShift are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?
General questions should go to the #contor IRC channel on Freenode instead of the issue tracker.

## Feature Requests & Implementation Proposals

If you have read the [README](https://github.com/contor-cloud/contor/blob/master/README.md) and feel a feature is missing from Contor, please feel free to open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. Of course you can also create a Pull Request implementing the proposed feature, that's even better!

## Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

You can chat with the core team on the #contor IRC channel on Freenode.
