## :construction: WARNING - WORK IN PROGRESS :warning:
This project is a Work In Progress and not ready for deployment, yet! Please consider contributing!

## Introduction

The objective of the Contor project is to provide the user with the means to set up their own personal cloud on their web domain using only open source software, so they're in full control of their data. It aims to provide cloud-storage, email, contacts, calendar, chat and videochat capabilities, all accessible through a browser interface or synced to their favourite app. With a highly-automated setup on a Kubernetes cluster it is easily deployed to any infrastructure, be it self-hosted or cloud-provided by a third-party, and can be maintained, managed and scaled with little effort.

## Containers

Contor will be distributed as an [Ansible Playbook Bundle](https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-playbook-bundle) for use on [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog)-enabled [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) clusters. The initial focus will lie on supporting the [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin) Kubernetes distribution. Check back here later for information on installation, setup and deployment.
